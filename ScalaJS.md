Scala.js is a relatively new feature in Scala that allows you to compile Scala code straight to JavaScript, providing you with the full power of the Scala language.

You use **three %** symbols to add libraries that were create specifically for Scala.js.

*The Scala to JavaScript compiler*. It is a safer way to build robust front-end web applications. With it, typos and type-errors are immediately caught and shown to you in your editor, without even needing to compile your code. Refactor any field or method with ease, with the confidence that if you mess it up the editor will tell you immediately.
